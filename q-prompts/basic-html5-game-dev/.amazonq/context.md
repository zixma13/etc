# HTML5 Game Development with Physics Engine

## Project Overview
Create a complete HTML5 game with a custom physics engine that includes collision detection, collision resolution, and physics integration loops. The game should be playable in modern web browsers and demonstrate practical physics concepts.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Game Structure
- Create new folder , use game name as folder name. If game name is existing, design new name that short, creative and relavant to game concept.
- Separate HTML file, CSS and JavaScript 
- Canvas-based rendering system
- Game loop with consistent frame rate (60 FPS target)
- Modular code architecture with separate classes for different components

### Physics Engine Components
1. **Vector Mathematics**
   - 2D vector class with add, subtract, multiply, normalize, dot product, cross product
   - Distance and magnitude calculations
   - Angle and rotation utilities

2. **Collision Detection**
   - AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection
   - Circle-to-circle collision detection
   - Circle-to-rectangle collision detection
   - Point-in-shape collision detection
   - Spatial partitioning for performance optimization

3. **Collision Resolution**
   - Elastic collision response
   - Inelastic collision response with restitution coefficient
   - Friction implementation
   - Impulse-based collision resolution
   - Separation of overlapping objects

4. **Physics Integration**
   - Verlet integration or RK4 integration for position updates
   - Velocity and acceleration calculations
   - Gravity simulation
   - Air resistance/drag forces
   - Mass and density properties for objects

### Game Objects System
- Base GameObject class with position, velocity, acceleration, mass
- Player-controlled object with keyboard input handling
- Dynamic physics objects (balls, boxes, particles)
- Static objects (platforms, walls, boundaries)
- Particle system for effects

### Game Features
- Player movement with realistic physics (jumping, momentum)
- Multiple physics objects interacting simultaneously
- Boundaries and platforms for collision testing
- Visual feedback for collisions (color changes, particle effects)
- Debug mode showing collision boxes, velocity vectors, forces
- Score system or objective-based gameplay

### Visual Assets and Sprites
1. **Sprite Management System**
   - SpriteSheet class for managing sprite atlases
   - Animation class for frame-based animations
   - Sprite class with position, scale, rotation, and opacity
   - Asset loader for images and audio files

2. **Open Source Asset Integration**
   - Use Kenney.nl assets (CC0 license) - excellent pixel art game assets
   - OpenGameArt.org resources for sprites, backgrounds, and effects
   - Freesound.org for audio effects (optional)
   - Generate simple geometric sprites programmatically as fallback

3. **Recommended Asset Sources**
   - **Kenney Game Assets**: https://kenney.nl/assets (platformer packs, space shooter, etc.)
   - **OpenGameArt**: https://opengameart.org/ (various CC licenses)
   - **itch.io Free Assets**: Many free sprite packs available
   - **Programmatic Generation**: Create simple colored rectangles/circles as sprites

4. **Asset Implementation Strategy**
   - Include asset URLs in code comments for easy downloading
   - Provide fallback to colored rectangles if assets fail to load
   - Implement asset preloading system
   - Support both individual images and sprite sheets

### Game Scenes and State Management
1. **Scene System**
   - Scene base class with update, render, enter, exit methods
   - GameScene (main gameplay)
   - MenuScene (start screen, pause menu)
   - GameOverScene (results, restart options)
   - SceneManager for transitions and state management

2. **Scene Components**
   - Background rendering (parallax scrolling optional)
   - UI overlay system (HUD, menus, buttons)
   - Scene-specific object management
   - Transition effects between scenes

3. **Game States**
   - LOADING (asset loading screen)
   - MENU (main menu)
   - PLAYING (active gameplay)
   - PAUSED (game paused)
   - GAME_OVER (end screen)
   - State transition management
   - Game difficulty for each stage or level i.e. snake game should focus on increase movement speed, chase should increase more AI intelligent etc.

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient collision detection using spatial hashing or quadtree
- Object pooling for particles and temporary objects
- Optimized rendering with dirty rectangle updates
- Frame rate monitoring and adjustment

### Code Structure Requirements
```
- GameEngine class (main game loop, update, render)
- PhysicsEngine class (collision detection, resolution, integration)
- Vector2D class (mathematical operations)
- GameObject base class
- Player class (extends GameObject)
- PhysicsObject class (extends GameObject)
- StaticObject class (extends GameObject)
- ParticleSystem class
- InputHandler class
- Renderer class
- CollisionDetector class
- CollisionResolver class
- AssetLoader class (sprite and audio loading)
- SpriteSheet class (sprite atlas management)
- Sprite class (individual sprite rendering)
- Animation class (frame-based animations)
- Scene base class
- GameScene, MenuScene, GameOverScene classes
- SceneManager class (scene transitions)
- UI class (buttons, text, HUD elements)
```

### Asset Integration Examples
1. **Sprite Implementation**
   ```javascript
   // Example sprite usage
   const playerSprite = new Sprite('player_idle.png', 32, 32);
   const platformSprite = new Sprite('platform.png', 64, 16);

   // Animation example
   const walkAnimation = new Animation(spriteSheet, [0, 1, 2, 3], 0.1);
   ```

2. **Recommended Asset Packs**
   - **Kenney Platformer Pack**: Characters, tiles, backgrounds
   - **Kenney Physics Assets**: Balls, boxes, springs for physics demos
   - **Simple Geometric Sprites**: Programmatically generated as backup

3. **Asset Loading Strategy**
   ```javascript
   // Include asset URLs and fallback generation
   const ASSETS = {
     player: 'https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-pack/player.png',
     platform: 'https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-pack/platform.png',
     // Fallback to colored rectangles if loading fails
   };
   ```

### Implementation Details
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Implement delta time for frame-rate independent physics
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Add extensive code comments explaining physics concepts
- Provide adjustable physics parameters (gravity, friction, restitution)

### Game Mechanics Example
Create a physics-based platformer or sandbox where:
- Player character with idle, walk, jump animations
- Multiple physics objects (balls, boxes) with different sprites
- Textured platforms and walls with tiled sprites
- Particle effects for collisions and special events
- Background scenery with parallax scrolling (optional)
- UI elements for score, health, or physics parameters
- Scene transitions with visual effects

### Visual Style Options
1. **Pixel Art Style** (recommended for simplicity)
   - 16x16 or 32x32 pixel sprites
   - Limited color palette
   - Clean, retro aesthetic
   - Easy to implement and modify

2. **Simple Geometric Style** (fallback option)
   - Colored rectangles and circles
   - Gradient fills and simple patterns
   - Programmatically generated
   - No external asset dependencies

3. **Mixed Approach**
   - Key game objects use sprites
   - UI elements are programmatically drawn
   - Particle effects use simple shapes
   - Backgrounds can be gradients or patterns

### Debug and Testing Features
- Toggle debug visualization (collision boxes, velocity vectors)
- Adjustable physics parameters via UI controls
- Performance metrics display (FPS, collision checks per frame)
- Step-by-step physics simulation mode

### Browser Compatibility
- Support for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Touch controls for mobile devices (optional)

## Deliverables
1. Complete HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
2. Well-documented code with physics explanations
3. Asset integration with fallback options
4. Multiple game scenes (menu, gameplay, game over)
5. Sprite animation system demonstration
6. README with game controls, physics parameters, and asset sources
7. Performance optimization notes and potential improvements

## Asset Sources and Licensing
- **Primary**: Kenney.nl (CC0 - Public Domain) - no attribution required
- **Secondary**: OpenGameArt.org (various CC licenses) - check individual licenses
- **Fallback**: Programmatically generated geometric shapes
- **Audio**: Freesound.org (CC licenses) for sound effects (optional)

## Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Basic physics engine with geometric shapes
2. **Phase 2**: Add sprite rendering and basic animations
3. **Phase 3**: Implement scene management and UI
4. **Phase 4**: Polish with particle effects and audio (optional)

This approach ensures the game works even if external assets fail to load, while providing a clear upgrade path for visual enhancement.

## Physics Accuracy Requirements
- Implement proper conservation of momentum
- Realistic bounce behavior with energy loss
- Accurate friction modeling
- Stable physics simulation without jitter or tunneling
- Configurable physics constants for experimentation

Please create a fully functional game that demonstrates all these physics concepts with clean, educational code that can serve as a learning resource for game physics programming.
